## Introduction
The purpose of the Global Share ERP System is to address the challenges faced by organizations in managing employee tasks, recruiting the right talent, and promoting employee engagement.

## System Overview
The Global Share ERP System consists of several interconnected components that work together to support volunteer recruitment, management, and reward systems. These components include:

1. General Overview Website: A public-facing website that provides information about Global Share's mission, activities, and volunteer opportunities. It includes pages for each section, a privacy policy page, a feedback form, and a login page for volunteers and HR employees.

2. Volunteers Management Subsystem: Enables volunteers to log hours, view department tasks, update profiles, and request membership extensions or freezes. HR employees can manage volunteer profiles, search/filter volunteers, and generate reports on volunteer activity and performance.

3. Recruitment Subsystem: Allows HR employees to manage job applications, control vacancies, track the recruitment process, and send automated emails to applicants. Feedback from HR employees and orchestrators can be gathered through the system.

4. Dashboards: A dedicated section for managing the organization's structure, including squads, positions, and volunteer positions.

5. Performance & Gamification Subsystem: Conducts performance evaluations, tracks KPIs and competencies, and provides progress reports. Rewards or penalties, such as hearts or yellow/red cards, can be assigned to volunteers.

6. Task Management Subsystem: Enables volunteers to view department boards and tasks, create new tasks, assign tasks to other members, track task progress, set priorities, filter and sort tasks, and add comments and attachments.
